Q.1 Write a Program to create a Student Record System for 3 students using structure. Consider the below-mentioned attributes in the Student structure:
- stu_id
- stu_name
- stu_age
- stu_course
- stu_city
- stu_standard
- stu_school

input==
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

struct Student {
    int stu_id;
    char stu_name[50];
    int stu_age;
    char stu_course[50];
    char stu_city[50];
    int stu_standard;
    char stu_school[50];
};

int main() {
    struct Student students[3] = {
        {1, "Rutul soni", 18, "Computer Science", "Ahmedabad",12 , "XYZ High School"},
        {2, "Aakash taneja", 17, "Mathematics", "pune", 11, "ABC High School"},
        {3, "henry donawat", 16, "Physics", "delhi", 10, "DEF High School"}
    };

    for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
        printf("\nStudent %d:\n", i+1);
        printf("ID: %d\n", students[i].stu_id);
        printf("Name: %s\n", students[i].stu_name);
        printf("Age: %d\n", students[i].stu_age);
        printf("Course: %s\n", students[i].stu_course);
        printf("City: %s\n", students[i].stu_city);
        printf("Standard: %d\n", students[i].stu_standard);
        printf("School: %s\n", students[i].stu_school);
    }

    return 0;
}
